# brazil-forest-fires

 I decided to analyze the Kaggle data set of forest fires in Brazil (https://www.kaggle.com/gustavomodelli/forest-fires-in-brazil)
 to find the trend in the number of forest fires over time, to find when forest fires occur with the highest frequency, 
 and to create a Tableau dashboard to visualize the change in the number of forest fires over time.
